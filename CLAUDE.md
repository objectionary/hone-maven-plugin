# CLAUDE.md

This file orients Claude (and humans) on how the `.phr` rewriting pipeline
is shaped and how to modify or extend it. It assumes the reader has skimmed
`README.md`, which contains the *what* and *why*. This file covers the *how*.

## The pipeline in one paragraph

`OptimizeMojo` calls `jeo-maven-plugin:disassemble` to turn `.class` files
into `.xmir` under `target/hone/jeo-disassemble/`. It then runs `phino` on
every `.xmir` to produce a `.phi` file under `target/hone/phi/`, applies the
selected `.phr` rules in alphabetical order to produce
`target/hone/phi-optimized/`, converts the result back to `.xmir` under
`target/hone/unphi/`, and finally calls `jeo-maven-plugin:assemble` to emit
`.class` files into `target/classes/`. The orchestration lives in two shell
scripts shipped as classpath resources — `entry.sh` runs the whole pipeline,
`rewrite.sh` runs the phino step — and they are launched either inside a
Docker container (default) or directly on the host when a matching `phino`
binary is found.

## Anatomy of a `.phr` file

A `.phr` file is YAML with four meaningful keys:

- `name` — used in logs only.
- `pattern` — a 𝜑-calculus expression with metavariables that phino tries
  to match against every sub-expression of the input `.phi`.
- `result` — the replacement expression. The same metavariables that
  appear in `pattern` (plus any computed in `where`) carry their captured
  values into the result.
- `when` *(optional)* — a side-condition the match must satisfy
  (e.g. `matches: ['lambda\$.+', 𝑒-target-method]`). If absent, the rule
  fires whenever the pattern matches.
- `where` *(optional)* — auxiliary metavariables computed by small
  string functions. See "Where functions" below.

### Metavariable prefixes

These are the only three; phino uses the prefix to decide what kind of
thing the variable can bind to.

- `𝐵-foo` — captures **a group of bindings** inside a formation. Use it
  as a placeholder for "all the other bindings I don't care about".
- `𝜏-foo` — captures **a single binding name** (`tau`). When the same
  `𝜏-foo` appears in `pattern` and `result`, the original name is preserved
  on the rewritten formation.
- `𝑒-foo` — captures **one atomic sub-expression** (a number, a string,
  a formation, a dispatch chain).

A rule like `401-fuse.phr` is a textbook reference: every flavor of
metavariable is used, and the `where` block shows how to merge captured
groups (`join`) and rewrite captured atoms (`sed`).

### Where functions

The string-level helpers that `where` blocks can call:

- `concat` — string concatenation; produces an `𝑒-` value.
- `join` — concatenate two `𝐵-` binding groups into one.
- `sed` — apply one or more sed-style substitutions to an `𝑒-` value.
- `tau` — derive a `𝜏-` binding name from a string value (used to give
  the result formation a name computed from the input).
- `random-tau` — generate a fresh, unused `𝜏-` name, with the args
  listing existing names to avoid collisions.
- `random-string` — generate a fresh string from a `printf`-style format.
- `number` / `string` / `sum` — type coercions and arithmetic; rarely
  needed but legal.

When in doubt, grep the `streams/` directory for the function name and
copy the closest existing usage.

## Execution order is the filename

`Rules.discover()` reads every `.phr` and `.yml` under
`org/eolang/hone/rules/` on the classpath, then `Collections.sort(names)`
puts them in alphabetical order. Phino is then invoked with the rules in
that same order. The `NNN-` prefix is *the* mechanism that defines the
pipeline stages:

```text
1xx  prep         remove dead labels, lower invokedynamic to Φ.hone.lambda
2xx  recognise    lambda + invokeinterface → Φ.hone.{filter,map,unbox,box}
3xx  fold         every pragma → uniform Φ.hone.distill
4xx  fuse         adjacent distills → one combined distill  ← the actual win
5xx  emit         distill → Φ.hone.mapMulti + private static method
6xx  unrecognise  Φ.hone.* pragmas → Φ.hone.lambda + invokeinterface
7xx  lower        Φ.hone.lambda → Φ.jeo.opcode.invokedynamic
```

If you insert a rule with a prefix that lies between two phases (say,
`345-`), it runs after `3xx` is done and before `4xx` starts. Always pick
a prefix that reflects which invariant your rule preserves on its
*output* — that determines what later rules see.

### Not every operation lives on the distill path (issue #570)

The 3xx description above is the *intent* — in practice only the
stateless point-wise operators are folded into `Φ.hone.distill`:

```text
filter   → 304 / 305 → distill
map      → 306 → distill
peek     → 307 → distill
type     → 303 → distill
transform→ 302 → distill
dup      → 301 → distill
```

Everything else short-circuits straight to `Φ.hone.mapMulti` because
it either carries state or emits a variable number of downstream
elements per upstream item:

```text
flatMap            → 208 (stateless, fan-out via Stream.forEach)
mapMulti (verbatim)→ 215 (stateless)
distinct           → 353 (state = HashSet seen-set)
take-while         → 351 (state = boolean[1] short-circuit cell)
drop-while         → 352 (state = boolean[1] gate cell)
skip(N)            → 353-skip / 354 / 355 / 356 (state = long[1] counter)
```

Each of these synthesises its own private wrapper method that feeds a
`BiConsumer` to `Stream.mapMulti`. Once a pipeline hands off to a
mapMulti pragma, `401-fuse` can no longer reach it — only `512` /
`513` can, and both require *positional* adjacency in the body, which
the per-operation state-init opcodes (`new HashSet` / `iconst_1 +
newarray`) silently break. The streams-full-non-terminal test
documents the consequence: `after: invokedynamic: 19` instead of the
single dispatch the architecture aspires to.

Closing the gap means routing the seven bypass operators through
`Φ.hone.distill` as well. That requires the distill pragma to carry
two new pieces of payload:

- **captures** — a list of state types whose values live in the
  `BiConsumer` instance synthesised by 501, mirroring what 351 / 352 /
  353 already build on the stack today.
- **emit-shape** — a marker distinguishing the current
  "one-in-one-out, auto-emit at end" body from a CPS body that drives
  the Consumer itself (needed for flatMap, mapMulti, and any
  short-circuiting state). `401-fuse` then needs to compose two CPS
  bodies via continuation passing rather than the current stack
  concatenation.

Once those land, 351 / 352 / 353 / 354 / 355 / 356 / 208 / 215 fold
into distill instead of mapMulti, `401-fuse` collapses every
sort-bounded segment into a single distill, and `501` emits one
mapMulti per segment — the path from 19 down toward the goal of one.

### Sorted and limit stay non-fusable (issue #570, Step 10)

Two stream operators are deliberately excluded from the distill
migration above: `sorted` and `limit`. They are *fundamentally* incompatible
with a single-pass `mapMulti` pipeline:

- `sorted` is a fully-buffering barrier — every upstream element must be
  consumed and held in memory before any downstream element can be
  emitted. There is no continuation-passing body shape that preserves
  this semantics while still flowing through a per-element `BiConsumer`.
- `limit(N)` short-circuits after N downstream emits. A merged distill
  would have to abort the surrounding `forEach` driver mid-stream, which
  the `BiConsumer.accept` contract has no clean way to express.

The chosen approach is **option (A)** from the plan: recognise both
operators as named pragmas so neighbouring stateless segments can still
fuse around them, but never fold them into distill and never merge them
into the surrounding `mapMulti`. Each `sorted` or `limit` therefore
survives as its own `invokeinterface` dispatch in the final bytecode.

The mechanics:

- `212-lambda-to-sorted` recognises `Stream.sorted(Comparator)` as
  `Φ.hone.sorted`. If no later rule consumes it,
  `607-sorted-to-lambda` lowers it back to the original lambda +
  `invokeinterface` pair, which 7xx then turns into bytecode.
- `216-recognize-limit-ldc` recognises `ldc + Stream.limit(J)` as
  `Φ.hone.limit`. The mirror rule `722-limit-ldc-to-invokeinterface`
  lowers it back when nothing fuses it.

The practical consequence: the `streams-full-non-terminal` fixture's
`after.invokedynamic` count is *expected* to land around 3–4 (one per
sorted/limit/limit pair) rather than 1. That is by design — the
architecture's value is fusing the *streamable* part of the pipeline,
not eliminating intrinsically-non-streamable operators. A future
"buffered-distill mode" (option B in the plan) could in principle fold
sorted into a Collector-style two-stage pipeline, but it is explicitly
out of scope for #570.

## phino: the only rewrite engine

There is no Java implementation of the rewriter. Everything is delegated
to the external `phino` binary, which is a Haskell program installed via
`cabal install phino`. The pinned expected version lives in
`default-phino-version.txt`; `entry.sh` refuses to run if `phino --version`
disagrees. Two phino subcommands matter:

- `phino rewrite --input=xmir --sweet INPUT.xmir` — converts an XMIR
  document into "sweet" 𝜑-calculus syntax (the kind that appears in
  `.phi` files and in `.phr` patterns).
- `phino rewrite --max-cycles N --max-depth M --sweet --rule=R1.phr
  --rule=R2.phr ... INPUT.phi` — fixed-point rewrite. Phino tries each
  rule at every position in the tree and keeps going until no rule fires
  or the `maxCycles` / `maxDepth` caps are hit. The `--output=xmir
  --omit-listing --omit-comments` form does the reverse direction.

The plugin runs phino in one of two modes (see `OptimizeMojo#smallSteps`
and `rewrite.sh`):

- **Big steps** *(default)* — every selected rule is passed on the same
  command line. Phino picks them up and applies them in a single
  fixed-point loop. Fast, opaque.
- **Small steps** (`<smallSteps>true</smallSteps>` or
  `-Dhone.small-steps=true`) — `rewrite.sh` calls phino once per rule
  and saves the intermediate result as `Foo.phi.01`, `Foo.phi.02`, ...
  in `target/hone/phi-optimized/`. `diff Foo.phi.07 Foo.phi.08` then
  shows exactly what rule `nnn` did. This is the canonical way to debug
  a misbehaving rule.

To run phino on a single `.phi` file by hand without Maven:

```bash
phino rewrite --max-cycles 1 --max-depth 500 --sweet \
  --rule src/main/resources/org/eolang/hone/rules/streams/401-fuse.phr \
  /tmp/Foo.phi
```

The output is the rewritten expression on stdout.

## How to add a new rule

1. **Pick the stage.** Decide which of the seven phases the rule belongs
   to (or that you are introducing a new phase between two existing ones)
   and pick the smallest unused `NNN-` prefix that places it correctly.
   Phase boundaries are recorded above; check `streams/` for the
   nearest neighbours before choosing.
2. **Write the `.phr` file** under
   `src/main/resources/org/eolang/hone/rules/streams/` following the
   header block (`SPDX` + `# yamllint disable rule:line-length`). Take
   the closest existing rule as a template; the metavariable conventions
   are not enforced by the tool but make rules readable.
3. **Run small-steps locally** on a representative `.phi` to see what
   your rule produces:

   ```bash
   mvn -Dhone.small-steps=true -Dhone.rules='streams/*' \
       org.eolang:hone-maven-plugin:build \
       org.eolang:hone-maven-plugin:optimize
   ```

   Inspect `target/hone/phi-optimized/...phi.NN` files to verify the
   delta.
4. **Add a single-expression test** under
   `src/test/resources/org/eolang/hone/rules/streams/expressions/` with
   a minimal `.phi` that the rule should transform, and a sibling test
   that asserts on the rewritten output.
5. **Add or update an end-to-end YAML** in
   `src/test/resources/org/eolang/hone/optimize/`. These specify the
   Java source to compile, the expected `log` lines, and the expected
   opcode counts in the class — `before` for the bytecode produced by
   `javac` and `after` for the bytecode produced by the optimizer.
   A count of `0` asserts the opcode is absent at that stage. Updating
   the `after` counts is normal when a rule changes how a stream
   pipeline is lowered.
6. **Bump the phino version** in `default-phino-version.txt` only if
   the rule depends on syntax or behavior that ships in a newer phino.

## How to extend the pipeline beyond `streams/`

Two extension mechanisms exist; they are independent.

- **Built-in subfolder.** Add a new sibling directory next to `streams/`
  (for example `arithmetic/`), drop `.phr` files into it with the same
  conventions, and select them at runtime with
  `<rules>arithmetic/*</rules>`. The `Rules` class will discover them
  via ClassGraph because anything under `org/eolang/hone/rules/` is
  picked up automatically. The selection grammar supports wildcards and
  negation: `streams/4*,!streams/411-*` includes all `4xx` rules except
  one.
- **External (extra) rules.** Without rebuilding the plugin, point
  `<extra>` at a directory of `.phr`/`.yml` files. `OptimizeMojo`
  copies them into a `hone-extra/` directory and `entry.sh` appends
  them to `RULES` *after* the built-in selection. Useful for project-
  local experiments.

## Tools to keep on hand when working on rules

- **phino** — install on the host (`cabal install phino` matching the
  version pin) so the plugin can skip Docker. The `Phino` Java class
  checks `phino --version` and runs the pipeline directly if it
  matches; otherwise it falls back to Docker, which is slower.
- **jeo-maven-plugin** — the bytecode↔XMIR translator. When debugging
  a roundtrip failure, run `jeo:disassemble` and `jeo:assemble` by hand
  to bisect whether the corruption was introduced by phino or by jeo.
- **GNU coreutils** — `entry.sh` and `rewrite.sh` require GNU
  `realpath` (or `grealpath`) and `parallel`. On macOS install via
  Homebrew (`brew install coreutils parallel`).
- **`hone.debug=true` and `hone.verbose`** — enables `set -x` in the
  scripts and `--log-level=debug` in phino. Output is voluminous but
  shows every phino invocation and every shell expansion.
- **`hone.grep-in`** — pre-filter regex on the XMIR text. The default
  skips classes that contain neither `map` nor `filter`. When iterating
  on a single class, narrow this further or set it to `.*` to disable.
- **`target/hone-statistics.csv` and `target/timings.csv`** — produced
  by `rewrite.sh` and `entry.sh` respectively. Useful for spotting
  rules that fire on many lines or files that take disproportionate
  time.

## What not to do

- Do not assume rules are independent. The `4xx` fuse pass relies on
  every operation having already been folded into `distill` by `3xx`;
  inserting an unfolded pragma at `350-` would silently break fusion
  on that method.
- Do not change `Collections.sort(names)` in `Rules.discover()`. The
  pipeline depends on alphabetical ordering as its scheduling
  mechanism.
- Do not hand-edit `.class` files in `target/classes-before-hone/`.
  That directory is the backup the plugin makes before mutation; it is
  the only way to recover the pre-optimization bytecode without
  recompiling.
- Do not introduce a rule whose `result` contains constructs that
  `jeo:assemble` cannot translate back to bytecode. The pipeline never
  invents bytecode the JVM cannot run, but it is easy to invent
  𝜑-calculus that jeo cannot lower. Verify roundtripping by running the
  end-to-end optimize goal, not just phino in isolation.
