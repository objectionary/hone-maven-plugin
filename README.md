This [Maven] plugin _may_ optimize your [Bytecode][bytecode] after compilation,
  to make it work faster.
Just add this to your `pom.xml` file (you must have [Docker] installed too):

```xml
<project>
  [..]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.eolang</groupId>
        <artifactId>hone-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>0.5.6</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>build</goal>
              <goal>optimize</goal>
              <goal>rmi</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <rules>streams/*</rules>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```

The plugin will do exactly the following:

1. Take Bytecode `.class` files from the `target/classes/` directory and copy
all of them to the `target/classes-before-hone/` directory (as a backup).
1. Using [jeo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/jeo-maven-plugin),
transform `.class` files to
`.xmir` [format](https://news.eolang.org/2022-11-25-xmir-guide.html),
which is [EO](https://www.eolang.org) in XML, and place them into
the `target/generated-sources/jeo-disassemble/` directory.
1. Using [phino](https://github.com/objectionary/phino),
convert `.xmir` files to `.phi` files
with [ùúë-calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13384) expressions,
and place them into the `target/generated-sources/phi/` directory.
1. Using [phino](https://github.com/objectionary/phino),
apply a number of optimizations to ùúë-calculus expressions in the `.phi` files
and place new `.phi` files into
the `target/generated-sources/phi-optimized/` directory.
1. Using [phino](https://github.com/objectionary/phino),
convert `.phi` files back to `.xmir` files and
place them into the `target/generated-sources/unphi/` directory.
1. Using [jeo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/jeo-maven-plugin),
transform `.xmir` files back to Bytecode and place `.class` files into
the `target/classes/` directory.

The effect of the plugin should be performance-positive (your code should
work faster) along with no functionality degradation (your code should work
exactly the same as it worked before optimizations). If any of these
is not true, [submit a ticket], we will try to fix.

## How to Use in Gradle

You can use this plugin with [Gradle] too, but it requires
some additional steps. You need to add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
task hone(type: Exec) {
    dependsOn compileJava
    commandLine 'mvn',
        "-Dhone.version=0.0.0",
        '-Dhone.target=build',
        '-Dhone.classes=classes/java/main',
        '-Dhone.rules=streams/*',
        'org.eolang:hone-maven-plugin:0.0.0:build',
        'org.eolang:hone-maven-plugin:0.0.0:optimize'
}
```

Then, you should create `pom.xml` file in the root of your project
with the following content:

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>org.eolang.hone</groupId>
  <artifactId>gradle</artifactId>
  <build>
    <pluginManagement>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.eolang</groupId>
          <artifactId>hone-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>0.0.0</version>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </pluginManagement>
  </build>
</project>
```

See how it works in [this example](src/test/gradle).

## How to Contribute

Fork repository, make changes, then send us a [pull request][guidelines].
We will review your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly,
provided they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration,
before sending us your pull request please run full Maven build:

```bash
mvn clean install -Pqulice
```

You will need [Maven 3.3+](https://maven.apache.org), Java 11+,
and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.

The versions of [EO] and
[JEO](https://github.com/objectionary/jeo-maven-plugin),
that we use, are defined in the `in-docker-pom.xml` file.
