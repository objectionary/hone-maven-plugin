This [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) plugin _may_ optimize
your [Bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode)
after compilation, to make it work faster.
Just add this to your `pom.xml` file
(you must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed too):

```xml
<project>
  [..]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.eolang</groupId>
        <artifactId>hone-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.21</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>build</goal>
              <goal>optimize</goal>
              <goal>rmi</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```

The plugin will do exactly the following:

1. Take Bytecode `.class` files from the `target/classes/` directory and copy
all of them to the `target/classes-before-hone/` directory (as a backup).
1. Using [jeo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/jeo-maven-plugin),
transform `.class` files to
`.xmir` [format](https://news.eolang.org/2022-11-25-xmir-guide.html),
which is [EO](https://www.eolang.org) in XML, and place them into
the `target/generated-sources/jeo-disassemble/` directory.
1. Using [eo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/eo/eo-maven-plugin),
convert `.xmir` files to `.phi` files
with [ùúë-calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13384) expressions,
and place them into the `target/generated-sources/phi/` directory.
1. Using [normalizer](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer),
apply a number of optimizations to ùúë-calculus expressions in the `.phi` files
and place new `.phi` files into
the `target/generated-sources/phi-optimized/` directory.
1. Using [eo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/eo/eo-maven-plugin),
convert `.phi` files back to `.xmir` files and
place them into the `target/generated-sources/unphi/` directory.
1. Using [jeo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/jeo-maven-plugin),
transform `.xmir` files back to Bytecode and place `.class` files into
the `target/classes/` directory.

The effect of the plugin should be performance-positive (your code should
work faster) along with no functionality degradation (your code should work
exactly the same as it worked before optimizations). If any of these
is not true,
[submit a ticket](https://github.com/objectionary/hone-maven-plugin/issues),
we will try to fix.

## Benchmark

Here is the result of the latest processing of a large Java class
from [JNA](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna):

## How to Contribute

Fork repository, make changes, then send us
a [pull request](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html).
We will review your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly,
provided they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration,
before sending us your pull request please run full Maven build:

```bash
mvn clean install -Pqulice
```

You will need [Maven 3.3+](https://maven.apache.org), Java 11+,
and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.

You may also want to run this (having
[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed):

```bash
make quick
```

This will do exactly what is happening in Docker container, but without
Docker. This may be a faster way to check how the pipeline works.

The versions of EO, JEO, and OPEO are defined in the `in-docker-pom.xml` file.
