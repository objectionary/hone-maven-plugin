This [Maven] plugin _may_ optimize your [Bytecode][bytecode] after compilation,
  to make it work faster.
Just add this to your `pom.xml` file (you must have [Docker] installed too):

```xml
<project>
  [..]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.eolang</groupId>
        <artifactId>hone-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>0.18.0</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>build</goal>
              <goal>optimize</goal>
              <goal>rmi</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <rules>streams/*</rules>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```

The plugin will do exactly the following:

1. Take Bytecode `.class` files from the `target/classes/` directory and copy
all of them to the `target/classes-before-hone/` directory (as a backup).
1. Using [jeo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/jeo-maven-plugin),
transform `.class` files to
`.xmir` [format](https://news.eolang.org/2022-11-25-xmir-guide.html),
which is [EO](https://www.eolang.org) in XML, and place them into
the `target/hone/jeo-disassemble/` directory.
1. Using [phino](https://github.com/objectionary/phino),
convert `.xmir` files to `.phi` files
with [ùúë-calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13384) expressions,
and place them into the `target/hone/phi/` directory.
1. Using [phino](https://github.com/objectionary/phino),
apply a number of optimizations to ùúë-calculus expressions in the `.phi` files
and place new `.phi` files into
the `target/hone/phi-optimized/` directory.
1. Using [phino](https://github.com/objectionary/phino),
convert `.phi` files back to `.xmir` files and
place them into the `target/hone/unphi/` directory.
1. Using [jeo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/jeo-maven-plugin),
transform `.xmir` files back to Bytecode and place `.class` files into
the `target/classes/` directory.

The effect of the plugin should be performance-positive (your code should
work faster) along with no functionality degradation (your code should work
exactly the same as it worked before optimizations). If any of these
is not true, [submit a ticket], we will try to fix.

## How to Use in Gradle

You can use this plugin with [Gradle] too, but it requires
some additional steps. You need to add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
task hone(type: Exec, dependsOn: compileJava) {
    commandLine 'mvn',
      "-Dhone.target=${buildDir}",
      "-Dhone.classes=${buildDir.toPath().relativize(sourceSets.main.output.classesDirs.singleFile.toPath())}",
      '-Dhone.rules=streams/*',
      'org.eolang:hone-maven-plugin:0.0.0:build',
      'org.eolang:hone-maven-plugin:0.0.0:optimize'
}
compileJava.finalizedBy hone
classes.dependsOn hone
```

See how it works in [this example](src/test/gradle).

## Benchmark

Here is the result of the latest processing of a large Java class
from [JNA](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna):

Size of .class: 22Kb (22Kb bytes)
Size of .xmir after disassemble: 2Mb (2Mb bytes, 55205 lines)
Size of .phi: 837Kb (837Kb bytes, 26376 lines)
Size of .xmir after unphi: 2Mb (2Mb bytes, 55190 lines)
Optimization time: 9s (9189 ms)
